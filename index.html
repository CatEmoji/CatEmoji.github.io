        <p>I am a genderqueer trans girl, dyke, and academic/artist weirdo.</p>

        <p>My academic research focuses on transmisogyny, and my Master's thesis <i>Transmisogyny and the Abjection of Girlcock</i> looks at how trans women are cast as dangerous and disgusting intruders in (cissexist) feminist and lesbian spaces, theory, and media.</p>

        <p>My artistic practice centers an autotheoretical investigation into my body and experiences as a post-surgically transitioned femme, and interogates concepts such as the trans body, sexual and gendered difference, and the intersection of my identities as a dyke and a trans woman. I am particularly interested in how my body is read and consumed as a trans woman who has undergone bottom surgery, and how I can use my body to subvert classic cissexist feminist theory, or engage in the creation of new theory through my artistic and academic practices.</p>

         <p>(g)Ender Gallery is a digital art installation set in Minecraft, and produced as part of the 2021 Ender Gallery Residency program at the MacKenzie Art Gallery on Treaty 4 Territory in Regina, SK.</p>


         <p>(g)Ender Gallery consists of a monumental re-creation of my surgically-transitioned genitals, and while the installation is largely set within my body, it does not centre the body in expected ways. Instead, a museum filled with queer and trans moments from my lifetime takes up the space inside the monumental vagina.</p>

         <p>(g)Ender Gallery was meant to engage and challenge trans communities, and included a series of public talks and a dance party set inside the vagina which are archived below.</p>

          The Lesbian Body ⚧ (2020) is a short zine that seeks to trans-form Monique Wittig's classic lesbian text, <i>The Lesbian Body</i> (1973). Monique Wittig states that "the body of the text subsumes all the words of the female body," yet as a trans lesbian, I find my body excluded and abject within the context of this work. This zine seeks to rectify that abjection by adding and entering into conversation with the original cissexist text.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text of this short zine is included below, or you can download the zine <a href="./media/tlb/zine.pdf">here</a>.

        <p>Author’s Note (M.W.)</p>
        <p>
          <i>Le Corps Lesbian</i> has lesbianism as its theme, that is, a theme which cannot even be described as taboo, for it has no real existence in the history of literature… The body of the text subsumes all the words of the female [sic] body. Le Corps Lesbian attempts to acheive the affirmation of its reality. The lists of names contribute to this activity. To recite one’s own body, to recite the body of the other, is to recite the words of which the book is made up. The fascination for writing the never previously written, and the fascination for the unattained body proceed from the same desire. The desire to bring the real body violently to life in the words of the book (everything that is written exists), the desire to do violence by writing to the language which I [j/e] can enter only by force.

        <p>Author’s Note (C.H.)</p>
        <p>
          The Lesbian Body ⚧ challenges Wittig’s assertion that the lesbian body is limited to the cisgender dyadic female body. This text enters into a conversation with The Lesbian Body that seeks to extend and trans-form the work through plagiarism and the act of (re-)writing the body (of the text). Le Corps Lesbian can be understood as a fundamentally trans- text despite its cisnormative understanding of the lesian body (it seeks to (re-)construct a ‘female’ body outside the existing binary). To understand it as a trans- text is the first step to subverting its cisnormative gaze upon the lesbian body. To plagiarize the text, as a trans lesbian, is to trans-form the text into something new and more radical, to open the possibilities of the text and further explore the lesbian body.

          I am laid under an interdict in the city where you live. I have no right to go there. The women loose your dogs on m/e when I approach. Everything is denied m/e, even the right of asylum. I am overwhelmed by desperation when I hear your voice saying to m/e that I may not come, that they are determined to prevent m/e in every way… m/y cries m/y shrieks m/y ululations make your dogs shiver, they are at bay, I hear them whimpering… but whatever the impatience I provoke in them by m/y presence, they cannot prevent m/e from remaining here, they cannot compel m/e to move to a place where m/y voice would reach none of you.

          I begin to sing as you sink your teeth into the flesh of m/y cock m/y most beautiful one, m/y most feared one. I feel your incisors slice into m/y glans, split m/y shaft in two, tearing the sponge like tissue. Your tongue explores m/y now barred corpus cavernosum travels up m/y urethra until it reaches m/y bladder. Left unsatisfied you begin to probe m/y seminal vesicle m/y prostate m/y vas deferens. As you explore each tube bodily fluids spill out of m/e and onto your hungry face and you moan in abject pleasure as m/y cum and blood and saliva begins to fill your lungs. Unable to breath you dig your face deeper into m/y body filling m/y scrotum and moving up into m/y stomach. I feel your face inside m/e biting at m/e transforming m/e.

          Flowers begin to germinate around m/e m/y most adored one. They overtake m/y epidermis m/y dermis m/y hypodermis hair follicles bursting forth with now grown flowers. I feel their roots pushing into m/y pores forcing pearls of bacteria and sebum deeper into m/y body. Smells of blooming flowers mix with the rotting flesh of m/y body m/y decay m/y putrefaction. As I give birth to new life m/y most adored one, I call out in the direction of the city to ask if I am welcome.
